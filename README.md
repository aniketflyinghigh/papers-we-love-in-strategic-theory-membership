# Papers We Love in Strategic Theory: Basic Information and Guidelines

This is the main information page for Papers We Love in Strategic Theory, a group devoted to the discussion and analysis of key papers in strategy and strategic theory. 

## Basic Information

### What's It All About? 

Papers We Love In Strategic Theory is a community oriented around the presentation and analysis of critical papers in strategic theory. See the top-level site description [for more](http://aelkus.github.io/papers-we-love-in-strategic-theory/) for a brief explanation about what this entails. 

### Who Runs It? 

I'm Adam Elkus, a PhD student in Computational Social Science at George Mason University. For more about me, see my page [here](http://aelkus.github.io). For all communications regarding this discussion group, please email me at `papers.we.love.in.strategy@gmail.com`. With the exception of the top-level description ([here](http://aelkus.github.io/papers-we-love-in-strategic-theory/)) and presentation summaries (posted [here](https://github.com/aelkus/papers-we-love-in-strategic-theory-presentations)), all important announcements and information will be located in this repository. 

### Why Haven't I Seen This Before?/Why Is It So Bare Bones? 

Well, I looked and I didn't see anything that fit the bill here in DC, so I decided to roll my own. If this takes off, I might invest in more infrastructure and a larger team to handle it. But until then, this is just one PhD student's attempt to get a discussion group on strategy and strategic theory off the ground in the simplest and most tractable form possible. 

### How Does It Work?/What Makes This Different?

As the title implies, we present and discuss papers in strategic theory. 'Nuff said. But how do we do it? And why is this distinct from ___ or ___? Beyond the meetings being focused around papers, Papers We Love in Strategic Theory features two types of paper discussions, each of which occurs once a month at a pre-arranged time. *DMV discussions* take place in the DC, Virginia, and Maryland area. *Virtual discussions* take place over Google Hangout or a similar group meeting system online. The core reason behind a focus on real-time discussions and academic papers in particular is the following: 

1. *Too much strategy-related content*. There are plenty of blogs, publications, and other forums competing for people's eyeballs. What there isn't enough of are forums for smaller groups of people to discuss strategy in a smaller, more conversational, and above all else synchronous (as opposed to asynchronous) setting. 
2. *Not enough sophisticated strategy content*.  There are plenty of publications, forums, and articles that run articles about "strategy," but few of them really are consistently conversant with established research, knowledge, and understanding about strategy. Hence, Papers We Love in Strategic theory focuses on papers and academic/theoretical ones at that. 

Hence, *DMV discussions* are informal get-togethers at a bar, cafe, or other establishment where either caffeine or alcohol (the two elemental forms of fuel for strategic thinkers) is served to discuss one paper or a few related papers on an issue of interest. The discussion takes the form of a guided dialogue between the presenter and the group. This will be done in an establishment located in the DMV (DC, Virginia, Maryland) area. While this discussion will only be open to those physically able to make it in person, there are virtual discussions for those who cannot. 

In contrast, virtual discussions are intended to bring the community events to those who cannot travel to the DC area. A presenter will take one paper or a set of related papers and present it to a virtual audience (via Google Hangouts or a similar mechanism). Once the presenter is done, the audience will then submit questions and comments, to which the presenter will respond. Presenters are encouraged to make their presentations graphically rich and entertaining, and in any event to also keep them not more than 35 minutes in length. 

### What Do You Mean By Strategy?

## Guidelines 

### Logistics

#### How To Sign Up 

Send an email to `papers.we.love.in.strategy@gmail.com`, and specify in the email title whether you are signing up for DMV Discussions or Virtual Discussions. If you want to do both, just put both in the email title. 

#### Calendar 

Due to the irregularities of my own schedule, each meeting's date and time will be announced as an calendar invite for those on a particular discussion list. 

#### Notes

If you miss a meeting, it will be written up and summarized, along with any materials that the presenter wishes to provide, [here](https://github.com/aelkus/papers-we-love-in-strategic-theory-presentations). 

## Submission Instructions

### Paper Sources

We want to have a high-level discussion of strategy, so please only submit one of the following: 

1. An academic journal article. 
2. A professional journal article (the military publishes journals, such as *Parameters* and *US Naval Institute Proceedings* that touch on strategy). 
3. A policy journal article (there are various journals, such as *The National Interest* or *The American Interest*, where content on strategy occassionally appears). 

If any of this is unclear, feel free to ask for clarification. 

### Paper Guidelines

Submissions are more likely to be accepted if they have at least *two* of the following characteristics: 

1. *Focus on classical papers in strategy*. If you are curious as to what kind of papers constitute "classics", see the *[Strategic Studies Reader](http://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Studies-Reader-Thomas-Mahnken/dp/0415772222)*. Obviously one's definition of the classics may differ wildly, so beyond something like the contents of the *Reader* please make a case for why the paper is canonical. If you feel that a particular paper is unjustly overlooked, feel free to say so! 
2. *Focus on a general issue on strategy rather than a particular one*. There are far too many current events discussion clubs, and this group is not going to be one of them. These focus on general issues, problems, etc and abstract and timeless issues and debates. If you are interested in the idea of doing something based on a current event or a historical case study, it should always be couched in terms of relevance to some larger debate, abstract problem, theoretical body of literature.
3. *Focus on a particular issue or viewpoint of interest to strategy that isn't typically covered in literature*. If you can relate something in any number of fields that typically are underplayed in strategy -- from economics to even philosophy or artificial intelligence -- to strategy and do so in a professional and credible way -- give it your best shot! 

### How To Submit

See [here](https://github.com/aelkus/papers-we-love-in-strategic-theory-membership/blob/master/how_to_submit.md). 

## Rules of the Road 

### Observe Chatham House Guidelines

We plan to observe [Chatham House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) guidelines. Many people interested in strategy are not at liberty to completely talk freely about it. Hence, while the generalized content of meetings, the presenter and topic, papers used, and other similar information will be summarized [here](https://github.com/aelkus/papers-we-love-in-strategic-theory-presentations), beyond that *who* said what and what they specifically said will be kept private. Violation of this rule is grounds for immediate and *permanent* expulsion. 

However, if you consent to allow the materials used in your presentation and discussion to be posted online, they will be put up along with summary. Presenters are encouraged to do so whenever possible as it helps create a record of what has been said, but if they cannot for occupational and professional reasons it is also OK. 

### Be Civil

Attack the idea, not the person. Given that this is inspired loosely by Papers We Love (a computer science meetup), I am going to reuse their [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Do not find yourself on the wrong end of it. If in doubt, just think about other people and don't be an asshole.

### Be Strategic

This is a community of people that study strategy or are interested in strategy. I trust that you will exercise sound judgement and discretion and do the following: 

1. *Think about me*. No one is paying me to do this, and as an academic (who just got recently married) I have a lot of other competing demands. So think of how what you do might impact me in view of those limitations.
2. *Think about group members who work for the government/military/intel services/etc*. There is a reason why many of my friends' online writings come appended with a lengthy disclaimer about their opinions not necessarily being those of DoD/IC/their mom/etc. Some of the people in the group will have limitations in what they can say and how they can say it, and we can only get their man-or-woman-in-the-arena insights if we respect those limitations. 
3. *Think about people that might otherwise not participate in these discussions*. Strategy transcends disciplines and communities. Carl von Clausewitz got some of his best ideas from physics. John Boyd studied everything from cognitive science to epistemology. Make it easier, not harder, for people that aren't a part of the usual crowd to participate in strategy discussions.
